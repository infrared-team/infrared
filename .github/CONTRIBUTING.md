Roadmap for Infrared
--------------------

Currently working on:

```
Lexer -> Parser -> Type System
         ^^^^^^
```

Setting Up your Environment
---------------------------

Have OCaml and Opam.

Build executable with `make infrared`

Test with `make test`

Build tests with `make generate-tests`. Be very careful using this, we don't want to make tests that aren't accurate.
